## About Me

I am a PhD candidate at The Australian National University.

My research focuses on understanding the mechanistic basis of the interaction between *Zymoseptoria tritici* and wheat.

On my YouTube channel, I run **"Candid with Candidates: Unfiltered PhD Life"** where I interview PhD friends worldwide.
